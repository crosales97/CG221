<div id="description">

  One of my major concerns in the disappearance of the bees is the fact that about one third of the crops 
  we eat would need to be pollinated by others means, or we would have a significantly lower production of food. 
  Hand-pollination has proven to be slow and expensive. In Fact, the economic value of bees’ pollination work has been estimated 
  to be about $280 billion annually, worldwide. Seeing as how the world’s population is growing and that we already run the risk 
  of lacking the sources to provide food for this growing population, I don’t see how the extinction of bees, who assist us in the 
  production of food, could be ignored. 
  <p>

Unfortunately it seems the we directly have been posing a particular risk to bees by using pesticides 
    that kill them. Of course many other things have been linked to the global decline of bees such as industrial 
    agriculture, parasites/pathogens, and climate change. In order to help the bees we must switch from industrial 
    agriculture to ecological farming. Using less harmful pesticides and working towards a more organic approach in 
    agriculture helps not only bees’ but ourselves and the environment as well.
