   <h2>Week 1 - February 1,2017</h2>

      <h3><a href="https://sleepyti.me">Sleepyti.me</a></h3>
        <p>This week I decided to use my favorite bedtime calculator, a interactive website by the name of sleepyti.me.
          The website works in two ways. It will allow you to input the time you need to wake up and
          in turn calculate/suggest when you should go to sleep in order to get a full nights rest;
          or it will calculate at what times you should wake up and give a total of 6 suggested times as to when you should set your alarm.
          I enjoy the simplistic design of the website although the desktop and mobile versions differ slightly.</p>
