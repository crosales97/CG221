        <p>While it may be somewhat lacking visually, this is one of my favorite websites in terms of introspective interactivity. 
          This website is an online adaptation of a card set created by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt. The website works like a shuffled deck, 
    in which you draw a random 'card' by hitting the sites refresh button that is intended to assist you should you encounter a creative dilemma. It's application is based on the 
    theory or idea that sometimes the frustration of obstacles may lead us to a more creative solution.</p>
