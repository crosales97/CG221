   <h2>Week 3 - February 15,2017</h2>

      <h3><a href="http://www.oblicard.com/">Oblique Strategies</a></h3>
        <p>While it may be somewhat lacking visually, this is one of my favorite websites in terms of introspective interactivity. 
          This website is an online adaptation of a card set created by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt. The website works like a shuffled deck, 
          in which you draw a random 'card' by hitting the sites refresh button that is intended to assist/inspire you, should you encounter a creative dilemma. 
          It's application is based on the theory or idea that sometimes the frustration of obstacles may lead us to a more creative solution.</p>
    
    <h3><a href="http://www.fallingfalling.com/">Falling Falling</a></h3>
        <p>Falling Falling is an endlessly entertaining visual and audiotory site created by visual artist, Rafael Rozendaal.
          It uses the contemporary art of artist Hampus Lindwall and places it in an endless loop of mesmorizing action,
          while music plays repeatedly in the background. </p>
    
     <h3><a href="http://www.tryingtrying.com/">Trying Trying</a></h3>
        <p>Trying Trying is an endlessly entertaining visual and audiotory site created by the same visual artist, Rafael Rozendaal.
           Once again he presents a visually animated loop of contemporaruy and had music play repeatedly in the background. I believe there
    to be, however, a change in tone in this site from the last</p>
