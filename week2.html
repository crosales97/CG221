    <h3><a href="http://portal.gplates.org/cesium/?view=rift_v">GPlates Cesium</a></h3>
        <p>GPlates Cesium is an interactive website that allows you to explore the movement of Earth's tectonic plates at different geological times.
        You can choose to view the site in either a 3D globe, 2D Map, or in their flat layed out "Columbus" setting. 
        It provides a data set which allows you to view/visualize Earth's major post-Pangea rift systems and to compare the changes in full rift velocity.
        Basically, you can watch Earth's tectonic plates go from pangea to where they are now. p </p>
