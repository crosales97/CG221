   <h2>Week 1 - February 1,2017</h2>

      <h3><a href="https://sleepyti.me">Sleepyti.me</a></h3>
        <p>This week I decided to use my favorite bedtime calculator, a interactive website by the name of sleepyti.me.
          The website works in two ways. It will allow you to input the time you need to wake up and
          in turn calculate/suggest when you should go to sleep in order to get a full nights rest;
          or it will calculate at what times you should wake up and give a total of 6 suggested times as to when you should set your alarm.
          I enjoy the simplistic design of the website although the desktop and mobile versions differ slightly.</p>
    
    <h3><a href="http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/">World Time Buddy</a></h3>
        <p>World Time Buddy is a Time Converter and World Clock that lets you compare and contrast different time zone in one glance. 
           You can choose which place(s) or timezone(s) you would like to align and use it to schedule or understand the results. </p>
