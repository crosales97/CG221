        JacksonPollock.org is a fun, simple interactive website in which users simply hover their mouse over any area of their screen 
        to create works of art similar to creations by abstract expressionist painter Jackson Pollock. I admire the websites simple design 
        and straightfoward interaction. I would criticize the lack of instruction (it took me experimenting on my own to realize to double 
        clicking allowed for the user to change the color of "the paint") however i can see how the simplicity of the websites design could
        be infriged upon by the addition of text.
