      <h3><a href="http://vladgotlib.com/circular/"> Circular </a></h3>

      <p>
        Circular is a website in which you can draw a circle and watch it be analyzed. You use your mouse to trace a circle
        on the screen and once you are done you can click the button which says analyze. This website
        will basically break down the composition of the circle you've drawn and compare it with how
        close you got to a perfect circle. It scores you based on: points drawn, radius, sum of errors,
        error/point, and disbalance. You can keep trying for hours to see if you can accurately draw a perfect circle
        and up your total "score". Aesthetically, im not a fan of the sites design, however, i do find <thead>
          concept of analyzing a circle and judging it by certain "criteria" interesting.

      <h3><a href="http://mrdoob.com/#/142/winning_solitaire"> Winning Solitaire</a></h3>

      <p>
        Winning Solitaire is a website which imitates the winning of solitaire on an old PC program.
        You can watch the cards bounce the way they would in the regular program with the addition of
        being able to produce more (an infinite number of) cards by clicking anywhere on the screen.
