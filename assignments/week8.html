        Virtual shower is exactly what it sounds like, an interactive virtual shower. The website allows you to select the duration
        of your shower, size of room, pressure, temperature, and even if there is any radio present. You can then click start 
        and begin an audio simulation of your virtual shower. The sites design is very simple, maybe not clean and streamlined, but 
        easy to navigate and understand.

      <p>
        This is an interactive website which also functions as a widget you can insert onto your own site. Its design is obviously simplistic, with no background, 
        a simple logo which links to the creators blog, and five wadling penguins. Using your mouse you can pick up these penguins and 
        drop them anywhere on your page/desktop :) .
