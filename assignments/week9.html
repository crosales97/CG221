      <p>
        'Dog' or www.dogs.are.the.most.moe/ is a site that I can only describe as a wholesome experience. Upon enterning this site you 
        will see that it explains
        its basic goal in big bitmap font which reads: "Pet The Dog" (followed
        by multiple explanation points which if intended to display has succeeded in my humble opinion.) Underneath this instructional "title"
        sits a "Pet Counter", which keeps track of how many times you have indeed pet the dog. The Dog is a white smiling pixelated dog which sits
        underneath the pet counter and is supposedly pet everytime you click on him. His facial expression becomes one of elation which every mouse click
        and the more pets you provide him with cause him to start spinning (with what we can presume is joy?), the spinning becomes faster the more clicks you give him
        and is admittedly equal parts entertaining, disturbing, and hilarious.

      <p>
        Big Long Now.com is a site in which you can repeatedly click and drag open doors. Its layout is simple black and white, as is
        it's objective. Upon first entering you will encounter a single door which once swung open will be followed by an infinite 
        number of doors. I like the simplicity of the site and design; I also appreaciate how the doors graphics
        are illustrated in a way (multiple angles of the doorknob, the dropped shadow, etc.) that provides an almost 3D experience despite 
        their black and white simplicity.
