        Type Drummer is a website in which words turn into drumbeats. Created by web developer Kyle Sterz, it's design is just as simple 
        as its purpose. You type anything into the provided box and immediately a beat will be produced by the site. 
        You can use it for simple entertainment or attempt to actually create a coherent complicated pattern and even share your 
        created beat. I really enjoy the sites simple logo and calming colors as well as the font choice which I think only 
        serves to give it a more modern, novelty, and effortless look.

      <h3><a href="http://mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/google-gravity/">Google Gravity</a></h3>

        Google Gravity is a site that doesn't offer much, but that I would assume brings about amusement to any frequent google user. 
        When first loaded the site appears to be your average Google home page, one quick mouse over however proves otherwise. As if there were 
        gravity on the internet the page appears to "collapse" before your very eyes.
        Once collapsed you can sift around the toppled buttons that once made up the google home page and even type in the fallen search bar. 
        Personally i found it fun to flip around the google logo itself.
        And Probably one of the most amusing thigs about the site is you can still access your google + account, drive, and even your gmail from its fallen ruins.
